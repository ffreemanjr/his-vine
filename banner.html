        <p class="paragraph">
          <strong>Free Advent Banner</strong> was an outreach ministry began by the founder of the Free Seventh-day Adventists, John W. Manns. The reasons for becoming “Free Seventh-day Adventists” is clearly documented in the newsletters and articles therein. In brief, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists demonstrated rank bias and prejudice against the person of color, particularly in the South, refusing to provide any material support of any kind, and denying them any position within the General Conference from which they could exercise influence towards their support. (See Articles in April, May and June 1921 for example)
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The <strong>Banners</strong> we have made available are part of an archive located at Loma Linda University. They are a matter of public record and so are freely available to anyone who can access the archive. What we have published is all that is available. But they are sufficient to detail what they believed and why, and that they were true to the calling of God, even in the face of bitter rejection by their supposed brethren in the General Conference. But like they said in some of their statements, they did not desire war, but peace with their brethren, using the example of Abraham and Lot, and their separation as friends and family, and not enemies.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          However, the originals have not been preserved in pristine condition. They are seriously discolored, marked on, torn in places, and very difficult to read. We here at HIS Vine Free SDA Church have made every effort possible to restore the Banners to the best possible condition in order to share with the world the reason why there are Free Seventh-day Adventists, that they are indeed rooted and grounded in Present Truth, founded upon the Historical Message that the servant of the Lord plainly stated we were to stand on until the end of time when Jesus comes.

          “In a vision of the night I was shown distinctly that these sentiments have been looked upon by some as the grand truths that are to be brought in and made prominent at the present time. I was shown a platform, braced by solid timbers,-- the truths of the Word of God. Some one high in responsibility in the medical work was directing this man and that man to loosen the timbers supporting this platform. Then I heard a voice saying, "Where are the watchmen that ought to be standing on the walls of Zion? Are they asleep? This foundation was built by the Masterworker, and will stand storm and tempest. Will they permit this man to present doctrines that deny the past experience of the people of God? The time has come to take decided action."

          “The enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation was to take place among Seventh-day Adventists, and that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith, and engaging in a process of reorganization. Were this reformation to take place, what would result? The principles of truth that God in His wisdom has given to the remnant church, would be discarded. Our religion would be changed. The fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last fifty years would be accounted as error. A new organization would be established. Books of a new order would be written. A system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced. The founders of this system would go into the cities, and do a wonderful work. The Sabbath, of course, would be lightly regarded, as also the God who created it. Nothing would be allowed to stand in the way of the new movement. The leaders would teach that virtue is better than vice, but God being removed, they would place their dependence on human power, which, without God, is worthless. Their foundation would be built on the sand, and storm and tempest would sweep away the structure.

          “Who has authority to begin such a movement? We have our Bibles. We have our experience, attested to by the miraculous working of the Holy Spirit. We have a truth that admits of no compromise. Shall we not repudiate everything that is not in harmony with this truth?

          “I hesitated and delayed about the sending out of that which the Spirit of the Lord impelled me to write. I did not want to be compelled to present the misleading influence of these sophistries. But in the providence of God, the errors that have been coming in must be met….

          “Many of our people do not realize how firmly the foundation of our faith has been laid. My husband, Elder Joseph Bates, Father Pierce, Elder Edson, and others who were keen, noble, and true, were among those who, after the passing of the time in 1844, searched for the truth as for hidden treasure. I met with them, and we studied and prayed earnestly. Often we remained together until late at night, and sometimes through the entire night, praying for light and studying the word. Again and again these brethren came together to study the Bible, in order that they might know its meaning, and be prepared to teach it with power. When they came to the point in their study where they said, "We can do nothing more," the Spirit of the Lord would come upon me, I would be taken off in vision, and a clear explanation of the passages we had been studying would be given me, with instruction as to how we were to labor and teach effectively. Thus light was given that helped us to understand the scriptures in regard to Christ, His mission, and His priesthood. A line of truth extending from that time to the time when we shall enter the city of God, was made plain to me, and I gave to others the instruction that the Lord had given me.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
          “During this whole time I could not understand the reasoning of the brethren. My mind was locked, as it were, and I could not comprehend the meaning of the scriptures we were studying. This was one of the greatest sor of my life. I was in this condition of mind until all the principal points of our faith were made clear to our minds, in harmony with the word of God. The brethren knew that when not in vision, I could not understand these matters, and they accepted as light direct from heaven the revelations given.<cite>{SpTB02 57.1}</cite>

        <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
          “What influence is it that would lead men at this stage of our history to work in an underhanded, powerful way to tear down the foundation of our faith,-- the foundation that was laid at the beginning of our work by prayerful study of the word and by revelation? Upon this foundation we have been building for the past fifty years. Do you wonder that when I see the beginning of a work that would remove some of the pillars of our faith, I have something to say? I must obey the command, "Meet it!"

          “We are God's commandment-keeping people. For the past fifty years every phase of heresy has been brought to bear upon us, to becloud our minds regarding the teaching of the word,--especially concerning the ministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, and the message of heaven for these last days, as given by the angels of the fourteenth chapter of Revelation. Messages of every order and kind have been urged upon Seventh-day Adventists, to take the place of the truth which, point by point, has been sought out by prayerful study, and testified to by the miracle-working power of the Lord. But the way-marks which have made us what we are, are to be preserved, and they will be preserved, as God has signified through His word and the testimony of His Spirit. He calls upon us to hold firmly, with the grip of faith, to the fundamental principles that are based upon unquestionable authority. <cite>&mddashEllen G. White, Special Testimonies for the Church Containing Letters to Physicians and Ministers Instruction to Seventh-day Adventists, pgs. 54-59 (1904)</cite>

              Since most people have never heard of Free Seventh-day Adventism, we here at <strong>HIS Vine Free Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong> thought it appropriate to provide some background as to who Free Seventh-day Adventists are and where they came from.

It is interesting to observe that the financial and numerical records of non-whites have been kept since the early days of the church. Ellen White understood the plight of those workers in the south in those early days, and the need for both “regular and irregular lines,” that the work might be advanced in spite of these facts.

              One of the noted “colored" evangelists in Seventh-day Adventism—Evangelist John Manns, decided to assert his “liberty in Christ Jesus,” and the Free Seventh-Day Adventist movement was born. Thousands were baptized and nearly 120 churches formed under the name of “Free Seventh-day Adventists”. These churches were raised up in North America, South America, and the Caribbean.

Black preachers, blessed with the gifts of eloquence and imagery and substance, clearly defined the Adventist message with simplicity and power. Thank God, the message He has given us to preach comes interwoven throughout with power. It just needs “preaching” and “living,” and God’s Black Adventist servants were qualified by the Holy Spirit to do both. Across the land, a host of Christian soldiers preached with power: P. G.

              The Manns brothers—John, Charles and Lewis—worked very hard to build up the work in that part of the Southland, but when the work began to grow and needs for help and housing began to multiply, requests were made to the leaders of the organization only to be ignored. John W. Manns showed a great concern that all of the presidents were all White and no opportunities were granted to the Colored to lead even their own people in a wider experience in the building of the work. All of the funds were being sent to the conference but little if any was being returned to strengthen the work in the Black community. Manns was a very strong influential man who sought better relationship between the races. At that time Manns had the largest congregations in the South in Savannah. After making many appeals to the leaders for help with caring for the needs of his people, he became discouraged and severed himself from the Seventh-day Adventist body, although he still held to the biblical teachings of the church.

That was prior to the November 1920 issue of the paper.

              In the fall of 1913, Elder Lewis C. Sheafe and family left Washington DC., where he had labored with marked success for about 12 years to engage in aggressive Christian work in Los Angeles, CA. Here as in the East, the word of God was preached as Elder Sheafe could preach it, resulted as the Lord said, in drawing many to Christ. The outgrowth of the efforts put forth was a church in Watts, Cal., and another in Los Angeles Cal. Both churches have built comfortable and commodious meeting houses during the elder’s stay of a little over two years. Elder Sheafe found it necessary to leave the regular SDA denomination last fall and with him came the Berean church, of which he is pastor in Los Angeles Cal., because of the oppressive and unjust discrimination against the negro by the officials of the denomination. He, like Richard Allen, has founded…the free S.D.A. To this standard Elder J. W. Manns and church of this city have come. They stand united heart and hand in the work for extension throughout this country. Elder Sheafe has left his church in Los Angeles in the charge of a tried and true Brother, while he is here to cooperate with Elder Manns, the fearless champion of religious liberty.

              The Peoples Church, founded by Lewis C. Sheafe, was a noted trailblazer church in the history of the work. This church was also attended by the gospel teacher, Elder A. T. Jones. The Peoples’ Church came under scrutiny by the D. C. conference because of its association with A. T. Jones, and the protests made by the church concerning apparent discrimination. Two separations between The Peoples’ Church and the D. C. conference occurred during the early portion of the 20th century. During the last separation in 1917, the Peoples’ Church identified with the Free SDA cause. Leaders were very concerned about the potential influence of the church with other “colored” churches during that period. It is most unfortunate that Elder Sheaf separated from Elder Manns in 1917 and returned to Washington D.C. and The Peoples’ Church. He eventually separated from Adventism altogether, joining with the Seventh-day Baptists in 1926. It was this type of action that prompted one writer for the “Gospel Herald,” the predecessor of “Message Magazine,” T. B. Buckner, to find it necessary to publish a stark warning to the churches to stand together against this <strong>“Free Church.”</strong> He states the following in the year 1917.</cite>

A church, openly publishing against the organized body of Seventh-day Adventists, whose headquarters are at Washington DC…I have no railing accusation to bring against these deceived brethren and sisters, but only feelings of sorrow that the enemy was allowed to come in among them and pull them off on a tangent like that. They claim to be a free church, since they have separated from the body…When God himself cannot please everybody, how can the Seventh-day Adventist church please everybody? The Free Church at Washington DC under consideration has assumed the task of warning the mission S.D.A. churches of this country (composed mostly of colored people) against the organized body of Seventh day Adventists. My dear brethren of the mission churches, let me (being 28 years in the message) admonish you to stand by the organization and be assured that we need no advice from the ‘Free Church’ of Washington D.C…Satan is at the bottom of that independent movement against the organization.” <cite>T.

He was 48 years old at his death. This strong and promising leader was used by God to share the gospel truth with African-Americans and others. He was a blessing to the growth of the church.

            <p class="paragraph">
              In the last quarter-century, some have thought they could open up a church and use the name “Seventh-day Adventist” without any legal ramifications. All of those who so thought were quickly disabused of that notion by the General Conference Corporation of Seventh-day Adventists, who own a trademark on that name, as well as the title “Adventist” and intellectual property rights to the acronym “SDA.” This was done by the General Conference in 1980 using a Roman Catholic lawyer to do its work. In so doing, they have made what is to be a church into a business and is contrary to the Bible and the writings of Ellen G. White. See, e.g., <strong>1Corinthians 6:1-4</strong>. <cite>Ellen G. White, Testimonies to the Church, Vol. 8, pg. 69</cite>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph u-indented">
              And if that was not enough, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, through its Corporation, has taken the additional step of trademarking the name of Ellen G. White, any and all of her writings, letters, books, visions, periodicals, papers, and anything that is printed, written or recorded from, by, or about her. In so doing, they have also banned any mention of the history of Seventh-day Adventism without their permission and sanction. Thus, any preacher, teacher, layperson or student who tries to teach historical Adventism or use it as its platform, within the General Conference, and make use of the historical writings as confirmed by Ellen White (let alone outside the conference) or any of her writings, stands the risk of being censored by the General Conference, including the seizure of any and all of that material in that person’s possession, and the risk of being sued, defamed and ostracized by the same General Conference that supposedly is the representative of the remnant church. They have now taken the additional stop of removing Ms. White from her God-ordained position as the spokesperson to the church, or God’s mouthpiece to the church. Thus, we no longer believe the Conference, in any aspect, to be God’s representative of His remnant church, based on the actions taken by the General Conference Corporation and the General Conference as a whole who seek to dominate and control every aspect of Adventism as the leadership sees fit and which they have exercised their legal authority to so control. Like the Pharisees in Christ’s time, man again thinks himself sufficient to control all aspects of religion and faith, and have chosen to ignore the true testimony of the True Witness. We want so much more of God and so much less of man in our practice of faith and religion. This is also supported by recent claims and admissions that the General Conference and all churches affiliated with it, are in fact Laodicea as portrayed in Revelation 3, and that was Laodicea they will make it to heaven in that condition, purified at Christ’s coming. This statement shows how far they have departed from the historical platform established between 1848 and 1898. In 1850, Joseph Bates, one of the original founders of the Seventh-day Adventist movement, declared the nominal seventh-day Adventist to be Laodicea and compared them with Sodom and Gomorrha. He went on to state unequivocally, that only one church will be found worthy to join Christ in Heaven, and that is Philadelphia. He instructs all true Adventists to flee from the nominal church because all it contains is death. See&colon; Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, November 1850, wherein the following is quoted from&colon;&mdash;
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“‘I counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, [present truth, that has stood the trial of six years opposition, and now is shining brighter and brighter,] that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, [righteousness, or righteous acts of the saints,] and eye-salve that thou mayest see.’ [See the present truth.][<strong>Revelation 3</strong>] <strong>Verse 18</strong>. Jesus counsels no one to buy of Him earthly riches, etc., no; it is the present truth that the Laodiceans must have to be saved. ‘As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and repent.’ <strong>Verse 19</strong>. Jesus still loves some that are in the Laodicean church, and calls on them to repent. If they were deceived by false teachers, they must leave them as soon as possible, and be ‘zealous’ and ‘repent;’ for every one that is found in that state when Jesus leaves the Sanctuary, and ceases to plead for the honest ones among them, will be destroyed. They must get back into the open door in the Philadelphia church that no man can shut, where they came from; for that is the only true church, or place of safety. Read, in <strong>Verse 20</strong>, the last, loving message of Jesus to you, — ‘Behold I stand at the door, and knock. If any man hear My voice, and open the door, [the door of the heart,] I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.’ Jesus will commune with you if you will open your heart and receive the truth. ‘To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne.’ Thus the promise is extended from verse 18th to the 22nd. Now is the time to repent and turn to the truth. Be quick! Hasten for your life!!

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">
              “Jesus is cleansing the Sanctuary, or is blotting out the errors of the house of Israel. When this work is finished, He will take His place on the great white cloud. Then, the seven Angels will pour out the seven last plagues. This will begin the ‘great day of His wrath,’ <strong>Revelation 6:17</strong>. This is the day of Babylon's plagues. Her plagues will come in one prophetic ‘day, death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God Who judgeth her.’ <strong>Revelation 18:8</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph u-indented">
              “In all the land saith the Lord; TWO PARTS therein shall be cut off, and die; but the THIRD shall be left therein. God says He will bring the THIRD PART through the fire, and refine them. They shall call upon Him, and He will hear them. He will say IT IS MY PEOPLE; and they shall say the LORD IS MY GOD." First part, SARDIS, the nominal church or Babylon. Second part, Laodicea, the nominal Adventist. Third part, Philadelphia, the only true church of God on earth, for they ask to be translated to the city of God. <strong>Revelation 3:12</strong>; <strong>Hebrews 12:22-24.</strong> In the name of Jesus, I exhort you again to flee from the Laodiceans, as from Sodom and Gomorrah. Their teachings are false and delusive; and lead to utter destruction. Death! DEATH!!* eternal DEATH!!! is on their track. Remember Lot's wife.”

          <h3 class="heading-tertiary freesda__heading--tertiary">WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT?</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Beyond the legal ramifications, by the will of the Conference, most of our schools, hospitals and other institutions, including many churches, no longer even bear the name Seventh-day Adventist. And perhaps this is rightly so since a lot of these institutions no longer adhere to the principles that were set forth by the pioneers regarding education, health reform, health principles, the use of natural means, not chemicals or pharmaceuticals to heal and restore and preach the true message to the sick, weak and dying; and have excluded the Sanctuary Message, the Day of Atonement, the Three Angels’ Message and Righteousness by Faith from the pulpits. But that is not what God called us to be.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“<strong>No name which we can take will be appropriate but that which accords with our profession, and expresses our faith, and marks us as a peculiar people. The name, Seventh-day Adventist, is a standing rebuke to the Protestant world</strong>. Here is the line of distinction between the worshipers of God, and those who worship the beast, and receive his mark. The great conflict is between the commandments of God and the requirements of the beast. It is because the saints are keeping all ten of the commandments that the dragon makes war upon them; and if they will lower the standard and yield the peculiarities of their faith, the dragon will be at peace. But God’s people excite the ire of the dragon because they have dared to raise the standard, and unfurl their banner in opposition to the Protestant world, who are worshiping the institution of Papacy.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“<strong>The name, Seventh-day Adventist, carries the true features of our faith in front, and will convict the inquiring mind. Like an arrow from the Lord’s quiver, it will wound the transgressors of God’s law, and will lead to repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong>” <cite>Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 4b, pg. 54-55 (1864); Testimonies to the Church, Vol. 1, pg. 223-22</cite></p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“Every institution that bears the name of Seventh-day Adventist is to be to the world as was Joseph in Egypt, and as were Daniel and his fellows in Babylon. In the providence of God these men were taken captive, that they might carry to heathen nations the knowledge of the true God. They were to be representatives of God in our world. They were to make no compromise with the idolatrous nations with which they were brought in contact, but were to stand loyal to their faith, bearing as a special honor the name of worshipers of the God who created the heavens and the earth.” <cite>Ellen G. White, Testimonies to the Church, Vol. 8 pg.153.</p></cite>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“<strong>In the name of the Lord we are to identify ourselves as Seventh-day Adventists. If any one among us is ashamed of our colors, and wishes to stand under another banner, let him do so as a private individual, not as a representative of Seventh-day Adventist medical missionary work.</strong></p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">Let us take our position as Seventh-day Adventists. The name is a true expression of our faith. I am instructed to call upon God’s people to bring their actions into harmony with their name, of which they have no need to be ashamed. The Seventh-day Adventist faith will bless whenever it is brought into the character-building.” <cite>Ellen G. White, July 6, 1902 Letter to General Conference Committee and Medical Missionary Board.</p></cite>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>The purpose of this church as Free Seventh-day Adventists</strong>, is to proclaim present truth through the Sanctuary Message, Righteousness by Faith, the Three Angel’s Message, The Day of Atonement, and all other related messages thereto in accordance with the will of God, consistent with the True Message given by God and not according to the whims of the will of man. <strong>In order to present these messages in that fashion, it requires a return to the historical fundamental principles of Adventism set down by the pioneers of Seventh-day Adventism. We do not believe this can be done freely within the General Conference</strong>.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">So, in order to accomplish what we believe to be God’s will, we are taking what Ellen G. White referred to as “irregular” lines, and doing so through the legal act of becoming Free Seventh-day Adventists, which predates by 65 years the first act of the General Conference in obtaining a trademark over the name, and 92 years before the act of getting a trademark on the name of Ellen G. White and all of her works which should be available to the world along with the Bible as a witness to present truth. We do this to protect ourselves legally so that the true message of the Gospel can be preached in its fullness, nothing more. We are not a cult or an offshoot. We preach the message that God designed the General Conference to preach from its inception. We pray for and set an example for the General Conference to return to the true path that God has set for it as an organization. In no way do we work against it. Its members are our brothers and sisters. We demonstrate this fact by being both a ministry and a church that adheres to the principles of Historical Adventism as our platform and advancing present truth from that platform. We offer everyone a concrete alternative to the “regular” lines by conducting church services on Sabbath, Bible studies, prayer services, etc., and being a ministry seeking to restore our brothers to the truth of God’s end-time message through these “irregular lines.”</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“<strong>So often the same old difficulties arise and are presented in regard to disturbing the “regular lines.” But God will work in some way to make His people understand that the regular lines have become full of irregular practices</strong>. How many more years will it be before our brethren receive the clear, keen perception which calls evil evil, and good good? When will men cease to depend upon the same routine which has left so much work undone, so many fields unworked? Is not the present presentation enough to make men see that a revival is necessary and a reformation essential? If not, it is useless for me to repeat the same things over and over again.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“I want my brethren to begin to understand some things for themselves. God alone, by the quickening, vivifying influence of His Holy Spirit, can enable men to distinguish between the sacred and the common. God alone can make men understand that working on regular lines has led to irregular practices. God alone can make men’s minds as they should be. <strong>The time has come when we should hear less in favor of the regular lines. If we can get away from the regular lines into something which, though irregular, is after God’s order, it may cut away something of the irregular working which has led away from Bible principles</strong>.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“God’s principles are the only safe principles for us to follow. Phariseeism was filled with regular lines, but so perverted were the principles of justice that God declared, “Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey” (<strong>Isaiah 59:14, 15</strong>). How true these words have proved.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“It is God who gives men wisdom by which to tell truth from a lie. Those under His guidance almost instinctively separate the good from the evil. God is trying to bring the backsliders in prominent places back to their senses. He corrects the evils to which men who ought to know better, who have heard His warnings and reproofs, have held fast as if evil were a choice commodity of which not one grain must be lost.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“<strong>It is as hard today to break away from the regular lines as it was in Christ’s day.” Ellen G. White, MR 1450, Letter to Elder A. G. Daniells, dated June 24 and 30, 1901</strong></p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“There are many who will spend and be spent to win souls to Christ. In obedience to the great commission, they will go forth to work for the Master. Under the ministration of angels ordinary men will be moved by the Spirit of God to warn people in the highways and byways. Humble men, who do not trust in their gifts, but who work in simplicity, trusting always in God, will share in the joy of the Saviour as their persevering prayers bring souls to the cross. We would say to them, Go forth, brethren; do your best humbly and sincerely, and God will work with you. They should be strengthened and encouraged, and as fast as possible fitted for labor, that success may crown their efforts. They harmonize with unseen, heavenly instrumentalities. They are workers together with God, and their brethren should bid them Godspeed, and pray for them as they labor in Christ’s name. No one is authorized to hinder such workers. They should be treated with great respect. No one should speak a disparaging word of them as in the rough places of the earth they sow the gospel seed.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“Christ will be with these humble workers. The angels of heaven will cooperate with them in their self-sacrificing efforts. By the power of the Holy Spirit Jesus will move upon hearts. God will work miracles in the conversion of sinners. Men and women will be gathered into church fellowship.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“These workers are trees of the Lord’s planting. In a peculiar sense they bear fruit equal to the fruit borne by the apostles. They receive a reward in this life, and a glorious reward awaits them in the future life.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“It is time that church members understood that everywhere there is a work to be done in the Lord’s vineyard. <strong>No one is to wait for a regular process before they make any efforts. They should take up the work right where they are. There should be many at work in what are called “irregular lines.” If one hundred laborers would step out of the “regular lines,” and take up self-sacrificing work, souls would be won to the Lord. And the workers would understand by experience what it means to be laborers together with God.”</strong><cite>Ellen G. White, Spalding and Magan Collection, Letter to Brother Johnson, pg. 194-195 August 6, 1901></cite></p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented">“<strong>God selects His messengers and gives them His message; and He says, “Forbid them not.” New methods must be introduced. God’s people must awaken to the necessity of the time in which they are living.”</strong> <cite>Ellen G. White, “Reflecting Christ,” pg. 242</cite></p>

            <p class="paragraph">And yes, we are <strong>a self-supporting church</strong>. Some people have a problem with that designation. But what does it really mean? It means that we support ourselves from the tithes and offerings given to the church. <strong>A tithe is then paid to the World Assembly of Free Seventh-day Adventists</strong>, and the remainder to pay our pastor, support evangelism, and take care of the routine expenses of the church, including all outreach ministries.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"><strong>“MUCH OF THE WORK WILL HAVE TO BE MADE SELF-SUPPORTING</strong>. THERE IS MORE TO DO IN A SHORT TIME THAN CAN BE DONE IF MEN WAIT TO BE SENT AND PAID FOR THEIR WORK. A SELF-SUPPORTING WORKER IS TO HAVE YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT … SELF-SUPPORT IS AN OBJECTIONABLE WORD TO SOME, BUT The whole church needs to be imbued with the missionary spirit; then there will be many to work unselfishly, in various ways as they can, without being salaried.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “THE PROMISE MADE THOSE WHO ANSWER THE CALL TO DO THIS SIMPLE, HUMBLE WORK, IS THAT “He marks all that they do to help those in need of help. In the heavenly courts, when the redeemed are gathered home, they will stand nearest to the Son of God.” <cite>Ellen G. White, Pamphlet PHO12, pg. 12 (1909)</cite></p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “Shall the “regular lines,” which say that every mind shall be controlled by two or three minds at Battle Creek, continue to bear sway? The Macedonian cry is coming from every quarter. Shall men go to the “regular lines” to see whether they will be permitted to labor, or shall they go out and work as best they can, depending on their own abilities and on the help of the Lord, beginning in a humble way and creating an interest in the truth in places in which nothing has been done to give the warning message?</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “The Lord has encouraged those who have started out on their own responsibility to work for him, their hearts filled with love for souls ready to perish. A true missionary spirit will be imparted to those who seek earnestly to know God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. The Lord lives and reigns. Young men, go forth into the places to which you are directed by the Spirit of the Lord. Work with your hands, that you may be self-supporting, and as you have opportunity, proclaim the message of warning.” <cite>Ellen G. White, Spalding and Magan Collection, pg. 176</cite></p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “<strong>Self-supporting missionaries are often very successful. Beginning in a small, humble way, their work enlarges as they move forward under the guidance of the Spirit of God.</strong> Let two or more start out together in evangelistic work. They may not receive any particular encouragement from those at the head of the work that they will be given financial support; nevertheless let them go forward, praying, singing, teaching, living the truth. They may take up the work of canvassing, and in this way introduce the truth into many families. As they move forward in their work they gain a blessed experience. They are humbled by a sense of their helplessness, but the Lord goes before them, and among the wealthy and the poor they find favor and help. Even the poverty of these devoted missionaries is a means of finding access to the people. As they pass on their way they are helped in many ways by those to whom they bring spiritual food. They bear the message God gives them, and their efforts are crowned with success. Many will be brought to a knowledge of the truth who, but for these humble teachers, would <strong>Ellen G. White, Testimonies to the Church, Vol. 7, pg. 23</strong> never have been won to Christ.”</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “With intense interest God is looking on this world. He has noted the capacity of human beings for service. Looking down the ages, He has counted His workers, both men and women, and has prepared the way before them, saying: “I will send My messengers to them, and they shall see great light shining amid the darkness. Won to the service of Christ, they will use their talents to the glory of My name. They will go forth to work for Me with zeal and devotion. Through their efforts the truth will appeal to thousands in a most forcible manner, and men spiritually blind will receive sight and will see of My salvation. Truth will be made so prominent that he who runs may read. Ways will be devised to reach hearts.

Their lives inhale and exhale the fragrance of godliness. Their words are thoughtfully considered before they are spoken. They strive to promote the well-being of their fellow men. They take relief and happiness to the needy and distressed. <strong>They realize the necessity of ever remaining under Christ’s training, that they may work in harmony with God’s will. They study how best to follow the Saviour’s example of cross bearing and self-denial</strong>.

            <p class="paragraph">We, at <strong>HIS Vine Free Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong>, firmly and fully believe that God, in His eternal Providence, has provided us with the means and the way to fully proclaim the True Message of present truth without direct conference control and without fear of having God’s work within our church being curtailed or legally challenged by those without. The True church is not destabilized just because some of its faithful members choose to work in irregular lines. We quote Luke 9:50 wherein the disciples came to Jesus and told Him that they had rebuked an individual who was casting out devils in Christ’s name but who was not a “disciple.” Jesus rebuked them saying, “Forbid him not, for he that is not against us is for us.” That is us as <strong>Free Seventh-day Adventists</strong>, preaching the True Message of present truth in love and with a fervent desire to see people’s lives changed, being unreservedly surrendered to God through His indwelling Holy Spirit in preparation for the soon and imminent return of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ; and that we will have the character of our Saviour and be fit to be sealed, changed and translated when He comes.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> <strong>To Leave The Organizations Of Men, Does Not Mean To Leave The Church Of The Living God Of Which Christ Is Head</strong> (&mdash;By Elder J. W, Manns).</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “As soon as one accepts Christ, his name is enrolled in the book of life as a candidate for eternal life. This book contains the names of all who are members of the church. If we prove disloyal to Christ, and refuse to walk in the light, we thereby separate ourselves from the fold of His church, and in the day of judgment our names will be removed from the book of life. Those who are converted and are faithfully walking in all the light they have, constitute the membership of the church of Christ. These at present are scattered throughout the various denominations.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “Many professed Christians entertain the idea that to separate from the denomination in which they have been reared is sacrilege; but this does not necessarily follow. If this were so, then the Reformers committed sacrilege by separating from the church of Rome.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “There is but one source of authority to which Christians can pledge unswerving allegiance, and that is Christ. So long as a denomination remains loyal to Christ, we can affiliate with it; but as soon as it refuses to keep pace with the pillar of clouds as it advances toward the promised land, we are forced to choose between it and Christ; to stay longer with that organization is to become a partaker of her sins and receive of her plagues. See <strong>Revelation 18:4</strong>. The salvation of believers depends upon their loyalty to Christ regardless of earthly ties, or even of life itself. Some people go so far as to assert their allegiance to their particular denomination by declaring that they will remain members of that church as long as they live.</p>

            <p class="paragraph u-indented"> “This is a most dangerous position and if maintained would eventually lead to a separation from Christ. This Christian cannot pledge loyalty to any power but Christ. Our only purpose should be to maintain our membership in the one body of which Christ is the head.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"> <strong>Amen!</strong></p>
