        <p class="paragraph">
          <strong>Free Advent Banner</strong> was an outreach ministry began by the founder of the Free Seventh-day Adventists, John W. Manns. The reasons for becoming “Free Seventh-day Adventists” is clearly documented in the newsletters and articles therein. In brief, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists demonstrated rank bias and prejudice against the person of color, particularly in the South, refusing to provide any material support of any kind, and denying them any position within the General Conference from which they could exercise influence towards their support. (See Articles in April, May and June 1921 for example)
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The <strong>Banners</strong> we have made available are part of an archive located at Loma Linda University. They are a matter of public record and so are freely available to anyone who can access the archive. What we have published is all that is available. But they are sufficient to detail what they believed and why, and that they were true to the calling of God, even in the face of bitter rejection by their supposed brethren in the General Conference. But like they said in some of their statements, they did not desire war, but peace with their brethren, using the example of Abraham and Lot, and their separation as friends and family, and not enemies.

        <p class="paragraph">
          However, the originals have not been preserved in pristine condition. They are seriously discolored, marked on, torn in places, and very difficult to read. We here at HIS Vine Free SDA Church have made every effort possible to restore the Banners to the best possible condition in order to share with the world the reason why there are Free Seventh-day Adventists, that they are indeed rooted and grounded in Present Truth, founded upon the Historical Message that the servant of the Lord plainly stated we were to stand on until the end of time when Jesus comes.

          “In a vision of the night I was shown distinctly that these sentiments have been looked upon by some as the grand truths that are to be brought in and made prominent at the present time. I was shown a platform, braced by solid timbers,-- the truths of the Word of God. Some one high in responsibility in the medical work was directing this man and that man to loosen the timbers supporting this platform. Then I heard a voice saying, "Where are the watchmen that ought to be standing on the walls of Zion? Are they asleep? This foundation was built by the Masterworker, and will stand storm and tempest. Will they permit this man to present doctrines that deny the past experience of the people of God? The time has come to take decided action."

          “The enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation was to take place among Seventh-day Adventists, and that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith, and engaging in a process of reorganization. Were this reformation to take place, what would result? The principles of truth that God in His wisdom has given to the remnant church, would be discarded. Our religion would be changed. The fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last fifty years would be accounted as error. A new organization would be established. Books of a new order would be written. A system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced. The founders of this system would go into the cities, and do a wonderful work. The Sabbath, of course, would be lightly regarded, as also the God who created it. Nothing would be allowed to stand in the way of the new movement. The leaders would teach that virtue is better than vice, but God being removed, they would place their dependence on human power, which, without God, is worthless. Their foundation would be built on the sand, and storm and tempest would sweep away the structure.

          “Who has authority to begin such a movement? We have our Bibles. We have our experience, attested to by the miraculous working of the Holy Spirit. We have a truth that admits of no compromise. Shall we not repudiate everything that is not in harmony with this truth?

          “I hesitated and delayed about the sending out of that which the Spirit of the Lord impelled me to write. I did not want to be compelled to present the misleading influence of these sophistries. But in the providence of God, the errors that have been coming in must be met….

          “Many of our people do not realize how firmly the foundation of our faith has been laid. My husband, Elder Joseph Bates, Father Pierce, Elder Edson, and others who were keen, noble, and true, were among those who, after the passing of the time in 1844, searched for the truth as for hidden treasure. I met with them, and we studied and prayed earnestly. Often we remained together until late at night, and sometimes through the entire night, praying for light and studying the word. Again and again these brethren came together to study the Bible, in order that they might know its meaning, and be prepared to teach it with power. When they came to the point in their study where they said, "We can do nothing more," the Spirit of the Lord would come upon me, I would be taken off in vision, and a clear explanation of the passages we had been studying would be given me, with instruction as to how we were to labor and teach effectively. Thus light was given that helped us to understand the scriptures in regard to Christ, His mission, and His priesthood. A line of truth extending from that time to the time when we shall enter the city of God, was made plain to me, and I gave to others the instruction that the Lord had given me.

        <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
          “During this whole time I could not understand the reasoning of the brethren. My mind was locked, as it were, and I could not comprehend the meaning of the scriptures we were studying. This was one of the greatest sor of my life. I was in this condition of mind until all the principal points of our faith were made clear to our minds, in harmony with the word of God. The brethren knew that when not in vision, I could not understand these matters, and they accepted as light direct from heaven the revelations given.<cite>{SpTB02 57.1}</cite>

        <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
          “What influence is it that would lead men at this stage of our history to work in an underhanded, powerful way to tear down the foundation of our faith,-- the foundation that was laid at the beginning of our work by prayerful study of the word and by revelation? Upon this foundation we have been building for the past fifty years. Do you wonder that when I see the beginning of a work that would remove some of the pillars of our faith, I have something to say? I must obey the command, "Meet it!"

          “We are God's commandment-keeping people. For the past fifty years every phase of heresy has been brought to bear upon us, to becloud our minds regarding the teaching of the word,--especially concerning the ministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, and the message of heaven for these last days, as given by the angels of the fourteenth chapter of Revelation. Messages of every order and kind have been urged upon Seventh-day Adventists, to take the place of the truth which, point by point, has been sought out by prayerful study, and testified to by the miracle-working power of the Lord. But the way-marks which have made us what we are, are to be preserved, and they will be preserved, as God has signified through His word and the testimony of His Spirit. He calls upon us to hold firmly, with the grip of faith, to the fundamental principles that are based upon unquestionable authority. <cite>&mddashEllen G. White, Special Testimonies for the Church Containing Letters to Physicians and Ministers Instruction to Seventh-day Adventists, pgs. 54-59 (1904)</cite>

              Since most people have never heard of Free Seventh-day Adventism, we here at <strong>HIS Vine Free Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong> thought it appropriate to provide some background as to who Free Seventh-day Adventists are and where they came from.
