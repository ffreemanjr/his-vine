            Since most people have never heard of Free Seventh-day Adventism, we here at <strong>HIS Vine Free Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong> thought it appropriate to provide some background as to who Free Seventh-day Adventists are and where they came from.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text">
            "Who are the Free Seventh-day Adventists?" one may ask. The Free Seventh-day Adventist began in 1915 under the leadership of noted Adventist preachers, John Wesley Manns and Lewis Charles Sheafe. These pioneer workers never had any doctrinal disagreements with regular Seventh-day Adventists, but had to organize among themselves due to the racial restrictions of the times. These colored ministers suffered and endured great injustices both inside and outside their church. It was their desire to carry forward the work began by Edson White in Vicksburg, Mississippi, yet they were met with discouraging circumstances on every side. They refused to be hindered by any man. In the “Watson Letter” (<strong>Letter 267, 1905</strong> and <strong>Letter 262, 1902</strong>), it becomes obvious that Ellen White was very supportive through the use of her tithe of the work Elder Manns and others were performing in the south along with her son, J. Edson White, who established the Southern Publishing House. <cite>(Pamphlet 127)</cite>
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
            “By 1906 more Blacks emerged and began working feverishly in response to Mrs. White's appeal to labor for their own. In addition to J.H. Laurence, there were Sidney Scott, U. S. Willis, John G. Thomas, <strong>Lewis C. Sheafe</strong> , Fred H. Seeny, Thomas H. and Jonathan Allison, Paul B. Bontemps, John Frank Bookhart Sr., <strong>John and Charles Manns</strong>, John Stevens and others. Not all of these persons had attended the school (Huntsville), but they all shared the burden of preaching to and helping their people.” <cite>Dudley, Charles Edward Sr. "Thou Who Has Brought Us Thus Far On Our Way&mdash;The Development of the Seventh day Adventist Denomination among African Americans.” Book 3, Vol. 3&semi; Edited by Tama Henley Curry. Dudley Publications, 2000 pg.7 </cite> 
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
            “By the end of the nineteenth century, some African-American leaders had begun to establish Seventh-day Adventist congregations on their own in Georgia, Tennessee and Washington, D.C. John and Charles Manns began the work in Savannah, Georgia; Lewis C. Sheafe organized the first Seventh-day Adventist church in Washington, D.C; Harry Lowe started the church at Edgefield Junction, Tennessee; Alonzo Barry brought together a group in Louisville, Kentucky.” <cite>Id. pg.1-5 </cite> 
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text">            
            Unfortunately the brethren in leadership were not prepared mentally or spiritually for the increase of colored ministers, workers and members. 
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
            “The Adventist church was blessed with a dramatic increase in the African-American component of its membership-from 50 in 1900 to 900 by 1909. The church organized the Negro Department of the General Conference to give special attention to this growing membership. Blacks were sharing the biblical beliefs of the church with members of their own race whenever they came together. This growth in membership caused grave concerns to the leadership, who began concerted efforts to curb the rapid growth by dismissing some of the strongest and most prominent African-American soul winners.” Ibid. <cite>Ibid.</cite> 
          </p>
            <p class="paragraph freesda__text">
            John Manns experience and dismissal is a dramatic example of the unresolved issues of that time. One of the biggest of the issues was the deeding of property to the conferences for which they had little confidence, and in fact, on most occasions, refused to do so.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
            “The decree has gone forth from the leaders that all church property must be signed over to the conference. This applies especially to church property held by colored congregations. Some of these churches refused to comply with this decree. The People’s S.D.A. Church of Washington D.C. of which Elder Lewis C. Sheafe was founder and pastor would not submit to this order of things. The conference often has resorted to all kinds of tricks trying to secure the title to the property. So far, they have not succeeded. Then the Savannah, Ga. Church of which Elder Manns is founder and pastor, with a property worth $6,000 and a membership of ___ was turned out of conference connection, because they refused to deed their property to the conference. The same fate befell the Lexington, Ky. church of which Elder J. E. Brice was pastor.” <cite>Savannah Tribune, May 13, 1916</cite> 
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text">            
            Soon the work among African-Americans was considered a financial burden on the church. It is interesting to observe that the financial and numerical records of non-whites have been kept since the early days of the church. Ellen White understood the plight of those workers in the south in those early days, and the need for both “regular and irregular lines,” that the work might be advanced in spite of these facts. 
          </p>
           <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
            “It is time that church members understood that everywhere there is a work to be done in the Lord’s vineyard. No one is to wait for a regular process before they make any efforts. <strong>They should take up the work right where they are. There should be many at work in what are called “irregular lines.” If one hundred laborers would step out of the “regular lines,” and take up self-sacrificing work, souls would be won to the Lord. And the workers would understand by experience what it means to be laborers together with God.”</strong>  <cite>Ellen G. White, Spalding and Magan Collection, Letter to Brother Johnson, pg. 194-195 August 6, 1901</cite> 
          </p>
           <p class="paragraph freesda__text">            
           As the leadership began to view the southern work as a financial strain on the church, meetings were held to find out how best to close some of these southern missionary projects in order to relieve the financial burden as they saw it.
          </p>
           <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
           “After arriving in Nashville, Edson took the printing presses off the Morning Star and established what was later to become the Southern Publishing Association...It was established to print literature for distribution among the Colored people and the poor Whites in the South. In addition to facing challenges from people in the area, opposition from the brethren in Battle Creek had to be constantly dealt with. It appeared that the church leaders were determined to put an end to the work being done for people living in the south.
          </p>
           <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
           “Not long after this venture began, Elder A. G. Daniells, the president of the General Conference, along with some church leaders, visited Ellen White in her home at Elmshaven in California and urged that the operation be closed. It was a financial burden on the church, they complained. Not wanting the brethren to feel that she was upholding Edson, her son, in some wrongdoing, she agreed to the closing of the project. ‘However, after the brethren left, God spoke to her in a vision and chided her that she should stop listening to the brethren and listen to Him. She was warned that the Southern Publishing project was not to be closed but should remain in operation to serve Blacks and poor Whites living in the Southland.’” Ibid. See also, e.g. Letter to A. G. Daniells; MR 1112, Manuscript Releases, Vol. 14, pg. 203-205. <cite>A. G. Daniels, Manuscript Releases, Vol.14, pg. 203-205</cite>

           <p class="paragraph freesda__text">            
           As the majority of the Oakwood students who finished their courses were not being hired, along with their white counterparts, many had to become self-supporting (free). Because the workers in the south were being dismissed, underpaid, and outright neglected, Ellen White proceeded to venture outside the “regular channels,” to support the workers there. She also encouraged those who followed her example in this.
          </p>
           <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
           “It has been presented to me for years that my tithe was to be appropriated by myself to aid White and Colored ministers who were neglected and did not receive a sufficient amount to support their families properly. When my attention was called to aged ministers, White and Black, it was my special duty to investigate into their necessities and supply their needs. This was to be my special work, and I have done this in a number of cases. No man should give notoriety to the fact that in special cases the tithe is used in that way.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph freesda__text u-indented">            
            “In regard to the Colored work in the south, that field has been and is still being robbed of means that should come to the workers in that field. If there have been cases where our sisters have appropriated their tithe to the support of the ministers working for the Colored people in the South, let every man, if he is wise hold his peace.” <cite>Watson Letter, Letter 267, 1905</cite></p>

            One of the noted “colored" evangelists in Seventh-day Adventism—Evangelist John Manns, decided to assert his “liberty in Christ Jesus,” and the Free Seventh-Day Adventist movement was born. Thousands were baptized and nearly 120 churches formed under the name of “Free Seventh-day Adventists”. These churches were raised up in North America, South America, and the Caribbean. Elder Charles Brooks included Elder J. W. Manns in his hall of faithful historic black evangelist pioneers in the journal “Perspectives&semi;

            "Adventist workers, especially those who passed through Oakwood College, began to disperse all across this country and the world. Black preachers, blessed with the gifts of eloquence and imagery and substance, clearly defined the Adventist message with simplicity and power. Thank God, the message He has given us to preach comes interwoven throughout with power. It just needs “preaching” and “living,” and God’s Black Adventist servants were qualified by the Holy Spirit to do both. Across the land, a host of Christian soldiers preached with power: P. G.
