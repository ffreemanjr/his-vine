            <p class="pastor__text paragraph">
              Pastor Mills was born in Washington DC, and grew up primarily in Grand Ledge, Michigan, where he attended Seventh-Day Adventist Schools and later at Andrews University for two years. he was raised in a Christian home as third generation Seventh Day Adventist, and as he got older, he consistently developed and strengthened his  relationship with God. Pastor Mills recalls preaching his first sermon at the age of seventeen, and in 1998, he was ordained as an Elder and given preaching duties. From 2000-2002, he received Lay-Pastor training from Evangelist Ron Halvorsen, Sr. in cooperation with the Kentucky/Tennessee S.D.A. Conference. Since then, Pastor Mills has delved in further studies. Many who have heard him tend to consider him a Pastor.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary pastor__bio--heading">Education and Present Truth</h3>
            <p class="pastor__text paragraph">
            Primarily self-educated, Pastor Mills has acquired a wealth of knowledge, and is a very profound thinker. He has a passion for the truth, and a great desire to share that truth with others. He is never selfish with God-given knowledge, therefore, he has conducted many Bible studies with individuals who desired Bible truths.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary pastor__bio--heading">Resolute to God's Call</h3>
            <p class="pastor__text paragraph">
            One of Pastor Mills characteristics is that he will not present a message that he is not strongly convicted of, and therefore will not settle for mediocrity. He is convinced that God has not left us "gray areas" for our private and personal interpretation. This gives him an unparalleled confidence, which, if not understood, can be easily mistaken for arrogance.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary pastor__bio--heading">Life and work</h3>
            <p class="pastor__text paragraph">
            Pastor Mills for many years owned and operated his printing business, and now uses his talent in multi-media sermons/presentations, graphics design. He understands that physical health is as important as spiritual health, and therefore has a passion for promoting healthy living. Having the genetic disease Ankylosing Spondylitis, for which he will not accept the harmful drugs that traditional medicine offers, he has done years of study in natural health to manage the disease.

            <p class="pastor__text paragraph">
              This two-part series gives a detailed account of Pastor Mills personal testimony. Often times we see our pastors as men who have not endured anything in life. This personal testimony by Pastor Mills will show how God works in the lives of His people and create in all who desire to serve Him a right heart.
