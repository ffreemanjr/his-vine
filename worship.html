            “A prayer meeting will always tell the true interest of the church members in spiritual and eternal things. The prayer meeting is as the pulse to the body; it denotes the true spiritual condition of the church. A lifeless, backslidden church has no relish for the prayer meetings. Young men and women of no depth of religious experience, who are vain and proud and frivolous, can feel no satisfaction in engaging in religious exercises. They prefer to pass the time in flirtations or reading novels, or in other ways of pleasing and gratifying the feelings of the natural heart.”

      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Immediately following our worship sercie, we serve a hearty vegan lunch for everyone who chooses to eat with us. 
        Each Sabbath afternoon, when the Worship hour is finished, the church will enjoy fellowship while eating a vegan vegetarian only meal.  This meal is provided by the members for all who attend services.
        It is our hope that this will encourage each person to enjoy the entire Sabbath with our church as we discuss the day’s sermon and study Seventh-day Adventist Pioneer Writings and other important topics.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        This time gives us an opportunity to meet and speak with all visitors, as well as each other. Please join us each week during this time of fellowship in Christian love as we spend God's Holy Sabbath together.

        <p class="section-paragraph children-paragraph">
          We here at His Vine Free Seventh-Day Adventist Church use children’s Bible lessons that are designed to capture the interest of children and their parents, helping them understand the “big picture” of the great controversy. Using the King James Version Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy, each series progresses through the Bible stories in sequential order, laying the crucial foundation of understanding the origin of sin and God’s great plan of salvation.
        </p>
         “Our children are the Lord’s property; they have been bought with a price.  This thought should be the mainspring of our labors for them.  The most successful method of securing their salvation and of keeping them out of the way of temptation is to instruct them constantly in the word of God.”<br><p class="paragraph">– E.G.

            <blockquote>
              At every suitable opportunity let the story of Jesus’ love be repeated to the children. In every sermon let a little corner be left for their benefit. The servant of Christ may make lasting friends of these little ones. Then let him lose no opportunity of helping them to become more intelligent in a knowledge of the Scriptures. This will do more than we realize to bar the way against Satan’s devices. If children early become familiar with the truths of God’s Word, a barrier against ungodliness will be erected, and they will be able to meet the foe with the words, 'It is written.'

            <p>
              As needed, the pastor will hold baptismal classes for all desiring preparation for Baptism. The studies that will be used will be those our ministry staff has compiled and written that will reflect the true historic pioneer platform the Seventh-day Adventist Church was established on.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              The test of discipleship is not brought to bear as closely as it should be upon those who present themselves for baptism. It should be understood whether they are simply taking the name of Seventh-day Adventists, or whether they are taking their stand on the Lord’s side, to come out from the world and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. <strong>baptism there should be a thorough inquiry as to the experience of the candidates. Let this inquiry be made, not in a cold and distant way, but kindly, tenderly, pointing the new converts to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. Bring the requirements of the gospel to bear upon the candidates for baptism.</strong>  <br><br>

              <strong>One of the points upon which those newly come to the faith will need instruction is the subject of dress.</strong> Let the new converts be faithfully dealt with. Are they vain in dress? Do they cherish pride of heart? <strong>The idolatry of dress is a moral disease. It must not be taken over into the new life. In most cases, submission to the gospel requirements will demand a decided change in the dress.”</strong>

              I have had my mind drawn recently to the subject of our Sabbath meetings. The work of the Sabbath School needs to be elevated.
              The leader appointed to conduct the church service should study and learn how to interest others. On this one day in the
              week, all who love God and are striving to keep His commandments should be given an opportunity to bear their testimony.
              Do not plan to have a discourse that shall occupy all the time, while those who assemble are given no opportunity to confess
              Christ.
